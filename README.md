# Feed Reader Project

**Feed Reader** is an interactive JavaScript web-based application which loads feeds from various entries and allow users to read them.

## How to use

To get started, user can check the entries by clicking the hamburger menu on the top left. When an entry is selected, RSS feeds will automatically load using the `loadFeed()` function.

## Application files organization

The application logic is contained in the [app.js](js/app.js) file. Editing this file may stop the application from running, so be careful!

All the tests run by Jasmine can be found in the [feedreader.js](spec/feedreader.js) file.
